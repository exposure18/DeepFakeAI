## 📌 Project Overview
**SpectreEye** is an AI-powered tool designed to detect manipulated or "deepfake" images.  
By leveraging a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the application analyzes visual artifacts often imperceptible to the human eye, and provides a **confidence score** to determine whether an image is **REAL** or **FAKE**.  

The project includes a **user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy, single-image analysis.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔍 **Deepfake Detection** – Uses a trained CNN to classify images as either **REAL** or **FAKE**.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly GUI** – Simple Tkinter-based interface for quick image analysis.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design** – Separation of core prediction logic from the GUI, enabling scalability and easier maintenance.  
- 📈 **Scalable Architecture** – Trained on a large dataset of real and fake images for robust performance.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – Model building, training, and inference  
- **OpenCV** – Video frame extraction for dataset creation  
- **Tkinter & Pillow** – GUI development and image display  
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical operations
